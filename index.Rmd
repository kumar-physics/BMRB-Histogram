## RBMRB

BMRB has developed [RBMRB](http://bmrb.wisc.edu/RBMRB_doc/index.html) package to access and visualize chemical shift data using the popular data analysis langaugae 'R'. All the chemical shift histograms and densiies are generated using RBMRB to provide instant access to users. Interested users may install our RBMRB library either from  [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RBMRB) or [GitHub](https://github.com/uwbmrb/RBMRB) and reproduce the same plots locally.

## Histogram
Chemical shift histograms are generated using the binwidh of 0.1 ppm. 

## Densities
Chemical shift densities are independently normalized for every atom. 

## Visualizations

All these plots are interactive graphics. You may zoom in and out using mouse and particular distribution can be ennabled or disabled by clicking the atom list on the right
